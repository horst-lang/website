            <h1>About Horst</h1>
            <p>
                <hlight>Horst is a small, fast, and easy to learn scripting language.</hlight> 
                <br>Its main goal is to make a language that allows for beautiful code, which is easy to read and understand, but also easy and enjoyable to write.
                <br>We want to create something that lets you express your ideas in the most concise, simple, and elegant way.
                This project was founded by two German students who were interested in how exactly programming languages really work.
                On their journey to understanding that fundamental tool of our modern digital world, programming languages, they started the Horst project.
                Horst let them make a language that had everything they would have wished existed in other programming languages.
                To share Horst with you, we've decided to make it open-source.
                We did that to allow anyone to build their dream language together with us.
                Horst is still a really young language, which means we are not limited by backwards compatibility or conventions.
                <br>So if you want to go on that journey with us, we would love to see you contribute to the Horst project!
